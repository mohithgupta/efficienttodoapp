# Task Prioritizer 

So excited to share The Efficient To-Do App, a clean, minimal app for prioritizing and managing your tasks.

🎯 [Link to the App](https://theefficienttodoapp.netlify.app/)

This To-Do App is different because:
- ✔️ No log-in required - Just an ID (to sync data across your devices) and you're good to go!
- 😇 You can even continue without an ID (no syncing across devices)

- ⬜️ Attractive UI – So you can love what you are doing while finishing your prioritized tasks first
- 📤 No Hurdles, The App remembers the ID (if provided) (OR) your choice of continuing without an ID

🌟For people working together, Sharing this ID alone can make the work collaborative. The changes made in one place are reflected in the other and hence you need not refresh the page for each update.

- You can 📄 Mark a task as done, restore it, or Delete it!
